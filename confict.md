resolved conflict by putting the additional ingredient underneath the cheese, instead of having them on the same line.\
a better workflow wouldn't have helped, as there was initially no conflicts with the main branch, and I had to artificially create conflict by inserting an extra ingredient into the ingredient.md on the main branch.\
I assume the intended lesson is that seperating out all the work into individual team member branches would've prevented issues with merging into main.
